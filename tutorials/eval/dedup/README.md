# Fuzzy dedup evaluation example

This example builds an evaluation dataset from a completed fuzzy-deduplication
run and uses an LLM judge to check whether fuzzy dedup's keep/remove/group
decisions are actually correct. It does not change fuzzy dedup itself; it
audits the decisions fuzzy dedup already made.

This is an illustrative worked example, not a calibrated production
evaluation. The judging rubric, model, and per-field thresholds in
`judge_config/` are starting points -- re-validate them on your own data
before trusting the results at scale. The LLM judge is an automated opinion,
not ground truth: treat disagreements between the judge and fuzzy dedup as
things to look into, not proven errors.

## Pipeline

```text
1. 1_data_prep.py           -> download & extract a Common Crawl sample with jusText
2. 2_run_fuzzy_dedup.py     -> FuzzyDeduplicationWorkflow (identification only)
3. 3_build_pair_dataset.py  -> labeled document pairs from fuzzy dedup's decisions
4. 4_span_alignment.py      -> add span-alignment evidence (semantic_diff/truncated) to each pair
5. 5_run_llm_judge.py       -> LLMJudgeWorkflow judges each pair
6. 6_analyze_results.py     -> summarize judge verdicts vs. fuzzy dedup's decisions
```

Step 1 downloads a small Common Crawl sample and extracts HTML content with
jusText. Common Crawl pages are full of real exact- and near-duplicate
boilerplate -- cookie notices, legal disclaimers, navigation chrome, mirrored
or syndicated articles -- so fuzzy dedup and the LLM judge have real
decisions to make, and it's the same class of content the judge rubric in
`judge_config/` is written for.

**Prerequisites:**

- Step 1 needs network access to Common Crawl.
- Steps 2-3 need the RAPIDS/cuGraph GPU stages `FuzzyDeduplicationWorkflow`
  normally needs (MinHash/LSH/connected components).
- Step 4 is CPU-only (`difflib`-based span alignment run through Ray Data).
- Step 5 needs GPU(s) to serve a local judge model through Dynamo --
  `LLMJudgeWorkflow` only supports locally served models, there's no
  hosted-inference-API backend.

## Quick start

Each script runs standalone -- see the docstring at the top of each file for
a full example invocation.

```bash
# Step 1: download & extract a Common Crawl sample.
python tutorials/eval/dedup/1_data_prep.py \
  --download-dir output/dedup_eval/cc_warcs \
  --output-path output/dedup_eval/raw_corpus

# Step 2: fuzzy dedup identification.

  --input-path output/dedup_eval/raw_corpus \
  --input-filetype jsonl \
  --cache-dir output/dedup_eval/fuzzy_cache \
  --output-dir output/dedup_eval/fuzzy_ids

# Step 3: build the labeled pair dataset -- one strategy per run, one
# --output-path per strategy (see "Pairing strategies" below).
# --input-path/--input-filetype/--input-blocksize MUST match step 2 exactly
# -- see "Keep step 2 and step 3 inputs matched" below.
# These are raw pairs -- no semantic_diff/truncated yet, see step 4.

  --fuzzy-output-dir output/dedup_eval/fuzzy_ids \
  --output-path output/dedup_eval/keeper_removed_pairs_raw \
  --pair-strategy keeper_removed

# Step 4: add span-alignment evidence (semantic_diff/truncated) to each pair --

# Step 5: judge each pair. Edit judge_config/fuzzy_pair_judge.yaml first --
# set models[0].model to a local model path or HF repo id, and size
# num_replicas/tensor_parallel_size to your GPUs (set num_replicas: 1 for a single-GPU run).
# --input-path accepts a glob, so point it at one strategy's directory, or at
# several (e.g. output/dedup_eval/*_pairs) to judge them together.
python tutorials/eval/dedup/5_run_llm_judge.py \
  --input-path output/dedup_eval/keeper_removed_pairs \

  --disagreements-output output/dedup_eval/disagreements.jsonl
```

## Pairing strategies

`3_build_pair_dataset.py --pair-strategy` takes exactly one of the following.
Run the script once per strategy you want, each with its own `--output-path`
(they all read the same step-2 outputs, so re-running is cheap) -- keeping
one strategy per directory avoids ambiguity about which pairs came from
which strategy once they reach the judge.

- `keeper_removed`: pairs the document fuzzy dedup kept in a group against
  each document it marked for removal from that group. Directly answers
  "was this removal decision correct?" with one pair per removed document.
- `all_pairwise`: every pair of distinct documents within a group, including
  removed-vs-removed pairs `keeper_removed` skips. Costs more LLM calls
  (`C(n, 2)` per group of size `n`) but catches within-group grouping errors
  that keeper-vs-removed comparisons alone would miss.
- `cross_group_sample` (size it with `--cross-group-samples N`): samples `N`
  pairs of documents from *different* groups (including singleton documents
  with no group). These are pairs fuzzy dedup did **not** treat as
  duplicates -- a check for missed duplicates / false negatives, mirroring
  what `keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise` check for false positives.

Each pair is stamped with `pair_type` and `expected_duplicate`: `true` for
`keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise` (fuzzy dedup grouped them together) and
`false` for `cross_group_sample` (fuzzy dedup did not). `6_analyze_results.py`
compares the judge's verdict against this label.

## Keep step 2 and step 3 inputs matched

`3_build_pair_dataset.py` recovers each document's text by re-reading the
*original* input corpus and replaying `fuzzy_id_generator.json` (written by
`2_run_fuzzy_dedup.py`) to reassign the exact same `_curator_dedup_id` values
fuzzy dedup used. That replay is keyed by a hash of the exact set of files
grouped into each reader batch, which depends on `--input-path`,
`--input-filetype`, and `--input-blocksize`. Passing different values for any
of these to `3_build_pair_dataset.py` than you passed to `2_run_fuzzy_dedup.py`
raises a `KeyError` during id reassignment -- it fails loudly rather than
silently pairing the wrong text with an id. Keep the flags above matched
between steps 2 and 3.

The re-read result is cached as sharded Parquet under
`--cache-dir/CorpusWithIds/` and reused across `--pair-strategy` re-runs
against the same `--cache-dir` (delete `CorpusWithIds/` to force a re-read).
The cache records which `--input-path`/`--input-filetype`/`--input-blocksize`
built it and raises if a later run requests different ones, instead of
silently reusing a stale cache built from different inputs.

## Output shape

`pairs/*.jsonl` (step 3): `pair_id`, `pair_type`, `expected_duplicate`,
`group_id_a`/`group_id_b`, `id_a`/`id_b` (`_curator_dedup_id` values),
`doc_id_a`/`doc_id_b` (original `url` field), `text_a`/`text_b` (full,
untruncated -- kept for manual review; the judge is not shown these
directly). No `semantic_diff`/`truncated` yet -- step 4 adds those (see
below). Filenames and shard count differ by `--pair-strategy` (see
"Scaling" below): `keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise` are written by Ray Data's
own distributed `Dataset.write_json()`, so file count follows Ray's
partitioning, not `--pairs-per-file`; `cross_group_sample` still writes
`part_*.jsonl` files sized by `--pairs-per-file`, since step 4 can
parallelize across whatever files land here either way.

### Span alignment and truncation

`4_span_alignment.py`'s `build_semantic_diff()` aligns each pair's visible
text (the same `--max-visible-chars`-truncated view the judge is shown,
currently 6000 characters per side -- keep this in sync with
`judge_config/fuzzy_pair_judge.yaml`'s `max_model_len`) into `SHARED`/
`A_ONLY`/`B_ONLY` spans with stable IDs (`S001`, `A001`, `B001`, ...), using
`difflib.SequenceMatcher` over normalized word/punctuation tokens. It runs as
three Curator `ProcessingStage`s -- `TokenizerStage` (tokenizes `text_a`/
`text_b` once), `SpanAlignmentStage` (diffs the token streams into segments),
`SpanChunkingStage` (splits any segment longer than `_MAX_SPAN_CHUNK_CHARS`
characters into multiple spans, re-slicing `TokenizerStage`'s token lists
instead of re-tokenizing, and assembles the final packet) -- so alignment
happens per reader task via Ray Data -- one raw pairs file from step 3
becomes one task -- instead of a
single-process Python loop over every pair. Each core span is bounded by
`_MAX_SPAN_CHUNK_CHARS` characters before context padding, so one long run of unchanged text or one
long difference doesn't become a single undifferentiated block. Side-only
spans are additionally padded, at their outer edges only (not between
chunks), with a little neighboring shared text (`_SPAN_CONTEXT_CHARS`) so a
short changed value isn't shown in isolation -- e.g. for

```text
A: Applicable to Model X100
B: Applicable to Model X200
```

the packet includes an `A_ONLY`/`B_ONLY` pair covering "Applicable to Model
X100"/"...X200" rather than just the bare `X100`/`X200` tokens, so the judge
sees what the changed value actually refers to. Side-only spans also retain
`delta_start_char`/`delta_end_char`, the core boundaries before padding.
This is stored as the
`semantic_diff` field (`status`, `truncated`, `truncated_a`, `truncated_b`,
`span_counts`, `spans`) and is what `judge_config/pair.jinja` renders to the
judge -- the judge never sees raw `text_a`/`text_b` directly. `status` is
`INCOMPLETE_LIMIT` instead of `COMPLETE` if a pair produces more than
`_MAX_SPANS_PER_KIND` spans of one kind; `system.jinja` treats an incomplete
packet as unresolved rather than trusting a silently-clipped span list.

Truncation is explicit rather than silent: if either document exceeded the
visible-character limit, `pair.jinja` renders a `<truncation_notice>` telling
the judge a decisive difference could exist only in the cut-off portion, and
`system.jinja`'s deterministic policy requires `unresolved`/low confidence
rather than a conclusive verdict built only on "no difference was visible."
`6_analyze_results.py` excludes truncated pairs from the headline
disagreement rate for the same reason, reporting them as `num_truncated`
instead.

`judged_pairs/*.jsonl` (step 5): the same fields (now including
`semantic_diff`/`truncated` from step 4) plus a `pair_semantic_judgment`
column holding one nested `{"score": ..., "reasoning": ...}` result per
rubric field -- `span_content_profile_a`/`span_content_profile_b`,
`span_shared_basis`, `span_a_delta`/`span_b_delta`, `span_hard_conflict`,
`span_translation_status`, `a_can_replace_b`/`b_can_replace_a`,
`relation_type`, `material_difference`, `primary_material_difference`,
`dominant_overlap_source`, `primary_risk_factor`, `confidence_tier`. See
`judge_config/fuzzy_pair_judge.yaml` for the full rubric and
`nemo_curator/eval/llm_judge/LLM_JUDGE_CONFIG_SKILL.md` for how to change it.

Before bucketing, `6_analyze_results.py` also deterministically corrects
`relation_type` to `exact` for any untruncated, `COMPLETE` pair whose
nonempty original `text_a` and `text_b` are exactly equal -- since the judge sometimes returns `near_surface`
for this instead (`_correct_identical_text_relation()`; corrected rows are
flagged with `relation_type_corrected` in the disagreements output).
Zero side-only span counts alone are insufficient: alignment normalizes case
and Unicode, which can hide meaningful differences such as code identifiers.

### Optional coverage critic

Coverage reviews positive main replacement directions using span evidence. It
is disabled by default. To enable it, add this list alongside `stages` under
`execution` in `judge_config/fuzzy_pair_judge.yaml`:

```yaml
execution:
  stages:
    # Keep the existing main judge stage here.
  critics:
    - name: coverage
      source_judge: pair_semantic_judgment
      model_alias: judge
      system_prompt_path: critics/coverage/system.jinja
      prompt_path: critics/coverage/pair.jinja
```

Run step 5 as usual. The workflow starts one shared inference server and runs
one Pipeline: main judge → prepare coverage → NDD coverage → apply coverage.
No extra runner or model service is needed. Omit `critics` or use `critics: []`
to retain main-only behavior. The first version supports one coverage entry.
Model aliases and template paths reuse the existing configuration conventions.

The adapter preserves the original alignment packet and separates each unique
span's core delta from its padded reading context. The model sees those spans,
not the main prediction or dedup labels, and selects IDs in an eight-field
structured review. Python validates references and original offsets, then
applies the retained-coverage v4 veto rules. Coverage can remove an existing
positive replacement direction; it cannot create one. Empty-anchor objections
only affect containment, and explicit abstention produces an unresolved result.

Negative/unresolved main decisions and complete, untruncated, exactly equal
nonempty texts bypass review. Preparation writes `coverage_should_run`; the
NDD structured column uses `SkipConfig(when="{{ not coverage_should_run }}")`.
All rows enter the stage; skipped reviews serialize as `null`. Do not attach
score filters that remove rows if comparing complete input/output populations.

Input must use step 4's current schema, including delta boundaries on side-only
spans and boolean truncation flags. Invalid main summaries, missing boundaries,
invalid review references, or empty results on rows requiring review fail
validation. An incomplete/truncated packet cannot support a conclusive veto.
The adapter does not run the historical evaluator's main-decision arbitration;
compatibility covers coverage rules for a fixed valid main decision and review,
not equivalence of the complete v0.7.1 evaluator.

The original main result remains in `pair_semantic_judgment`. Added columns are:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `coverage_should_run` | Boolean routing decision |
| `coverage_review` | Raw structured review, or `null` for skipped rows |
| `coverage_action`, `coverage_reason` | Applied action and explanation code |
| `coverage_evidence` | Validated original quotes and offsets |
| `final_decision` | Eight scalar summary fields, using the main rubric's lowercase enums |

`final_decision` contains the two replacement directions, `relation_type`,
`material_difference`, `primary_material_difference`, `dominant_overlap_source`,
`primary_risk_factor`, and `confidence_tier`. Skips and keeps preserve those main
values; applied vetoes update the related summary fields consistently. Temporary
prompt payloads are removed. Reserved output-column collisions fail rather than
overwriting previous results.

Compare both decisions from the same output:

```bash
python tutorials/eval/dedup/6_analyze_results.py --judge-output-path output/dedup_eval/judged_pairs --decision-source main
python tutorials/eval/dedup/6_analyze_results.py --judge-output-path output/dedup_eval/judged_pairs --decision-source final
```

`main` remains the default. `final` requires `final_decision` and does not apply
the analysis-only exact-text correction. Check input/output IDs when accepting a
run: record loss from an upstream generation failure cannot be detected by an
apply stage that only receives surviving records. Routing counts describe rows,
not HTTP requests, which may include retries.

`6_analyze_results.py` (step 6) buckets `relation_type` into a coarse
duplicate/not_duplicate/unresolved verdict (`exact`/`canonical_exact`/
`near_surface`/`containment` -> duplicate; `version_related`/
`related_non_duplicate`/`unrelated` -> not_duplicate -- see the bucketing
rationale in the script's docstring) and prints, per `pair_type`: relation
counts and a disagreement rate against `expected_duplicate` -- for
`keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise`, the share bucketed `not_duplicate` despite
fuzzy dedup grouping them (candidate wrong-grouping rate); for
`cross_group_sample`, the share bucketed `duplicate` despite fuzzy dedup
keeping them apart (candidate missed-duplicate rate). These are diagnostics
from one unvalidated judge, not accuracy numbers -- for anything more than a
coarse rate, read `relation_type`/`material_difference`/
`primary_material_difference` directly rather than the bucketed verdict.

## Scaling `3_build_pair_dataset.py`

- `keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise` build pairs as a distributed Ray Data
  pipeline (`build_grouped_pairs_distributed()`): `ray.data.read_parquet()`
  streams `CorpusWithIds/` across the cluster, `map_batches()` tags each
  document with its duplicate-group id from a broadcast lookup, and
  `groupby(...).map_groups(...)` builds pairs one group at a time, distributed
  -- no single task ever loads every duplicate group's documents into one
  process, so this scales with cluster size rather than driver memory.
- `all_pairwise` still generates `C(n, 2)` pairs per duplicate group, and real
  web corpora routinely produce one oversized cluster (cookie banners, empty
  pages, templated legal boilerplate). `--max-group-size` (default 200) skips
  and warns about any group larger than that instead of letting one cluster
  generate an unbounded number of pairs -- raise it deliberately if you want
  larger groups included.
- `cross_group_sample` draws a bounded, approximately-uniform sample instead
  of materializing every document -- each Parquet part file contributes a
  subsample sized by its share of the total row count (from Parquet
  metadata, without reading the data first), capped around
  `max(cross_group_samples * 10, 2000)` documents regardless of corpus size.
  It stays driver-side (`build_cross_group_sample_pairs()`): it compares
  documents *across* groups, so there's no per-group unit of work to
  distribute, and its input is already bounded independent of corpus size --
  it isn't the bottleneck the Ray Data rewrite above targets.

What's still loaded fully into memory for every strategy: `group_labels_df`
(`ConnectedComponentsStage`'s output) and `removed_ids` (`FuzzyDuplicateIds`)
-- both scoped to documents that are part of *some* duplicate group, not the
full corpus, so they're bounded by your corpus's duplicate rate rather than
its total size. This is what `map_batches()`'s broadcast lookup above is
built from, and it's also `keeper_removed`/`all_pairwise`'s only remaining
non-distributed step. If your corpus is pathological enough that most of it
ends up in one enormous duplicate group, that assumption breaks down -- at
that point, sample duplicate groups before loading.

`4_span_alignment.py` doesn't share this limitation either: it's a `Pipeline`
of `JsonlReader -> TokenizerStage -> SpanAlignmentStage -> SpanChunkingStage ->
JsonlWriter` stages, so span alignment itself already runs distributed across
reader tasks via Ray Data rather than loading pairs into driver memory -- the
each input file forms one reader task in step 4.
