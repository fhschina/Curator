# LLM judge runner

Use this example to add LLM-based evaluations to JSONL or Parquet records. The YAML configuration defines the served judge model, Jinja prompt files, rubric scores, and optional output filters. The runner starts a local Curator Dynamo/vLLM server, executes NeMo Data Designer (NDD) judge columns, and writes the original records with the judge results added.

The included example compares jusText and Trafilatura web-text extractions. The same runner can judge parser output, extraction quality, or any task whose inputs can be rendered into a Jinja prompt.

## Environment

The repository requires uv `>=0.12.0`; this integration was validated with uv 0.12.3 and Python 3.11. For the standalone
runner, install both text and synthetic-data-generation CUDA extras from the checked-in lock:

```bash
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/raid/hfang/llm_judge_env_pr2324_latest
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache/uv
export HF_HOME=/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache/huggingface
export PATH=/raid/hfang/llm_judge_tools/bin:$PATH
/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_tools/uv sync --locked --python 3.11 \
  --extra text_cuda12 --extra sdg_cuda12
```

Add `--extra deduplication_cuda12` when this environment also runs the complete dedup evaluation. Keep this environment
separate from an existing dedup-only environment. uv-created environments normally omit pip; before starting Ray, the
runner automatically seeds the standard-library pip wheel with `ensurepip` because Ray 2.57's uv runtime plugin needs pip to
bootstrap uv in its cloned actor environment.

The lock pins `data-designer==0.9.1`. Its upstream PyArrow requirement conflicts with the RAPIDS/cuDF range, so
`pyproject.toml` deliberately overrides it with `pyarrow>=19,<24`; the validated environment uses PyArrow 23.0.1. The validated
runtime versions are Ray 2.57.0, vLLM 0.22.0, and `ai-dynamo` 1.3.1. Use `uv sync --locked` so these constraints are not
re-resolved independently.

Dynamo needs `etcd` and `nats-server` on `PATH`. The dedup Sarah/Qwen config expects them under
`/raid/hfang/llm_judge_tools/bin`, the model under `/raid/hfang/hf_cache/Qwen3.8-27B`, and Ray/uv/checkpoint state under
`/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache`. Keep `ray_temp_dir` short: Ray's dashboard Unix socket has a 107-byte path limit, and the
session-name suffix consumes most of that budget. The runner and dedup preflight reject an unsafe path before startup. Its
runtime setup timeout is 1800 seconds. The tracked dedup YAML also loads
`eval/dedup/resources/local_ndd/cutlass_compat/sitecustomize.py`, the verified compatibility shim for the installed CUTLASS
bindings.

## Reusing one local runtime

`LocalJudgeRuntime` owns Ray and the Dynamo/vLLM model server. Enter it once and call `run` for multiple batches to avoid
reloading model weights between an initial request and failed-subset retries:

```python
from eval.llm_judge.run_llm_judge import LocalJudgeRuntime

with LocalJudgeRuntime(
    "eval/dedup/resources/local_ndd/sarah_minhash_qwen.yaml",
    model_overrides={"judge": "/raid/hfang/hf_cache/Qwen3.8-27B"},
    ray_temp_dir="/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache/ray",
    num_gpus=1,
) as runtime:
    runtime.run(
        input_path="batch-1.jsonl",
        input_format="jsonl",
        output_path="output/batch-1",
        checkpoint_path="/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache/checkpoints/batch-1",
        files_per_partition=1,
    )
    runtime.run(
        input_path="retry-only.jsonl",
        input_format="jsonl",
        output_path="output/retry-only",
        checkpoint_path="/raid/hfang/dedup_eval_cache/checkpoints/retry-only",
        files_per_partition=1,
    )
```

The existing `run_llm_judge.py` CLI arguments and single-run lifecycle remain compatible.

Judge YAML may also set `execution.data_designer_run` with supported `data_designer.config.RunConfig` fields. The runner applies
that configuration to every Data Designer stage and reapplies it after Ray deserialization; configs that omit the block keep
Data Designer's defaults.

## Dedup Sarah/MinHash backend

The dedup pipeline uses `eval/dedup/resources/local_ndd/sarah_minhash_qwen.yaml` as its default one-model, one-B200 Judge.
Gemma is not part of the default decision or agreement logic. Stage 6 keeps canonical pair IDs and payload hashes for joining,
but its Jinja prompt exposes only cleaned text and explicit long-document windows—never URL, language, SUT group/action, or
retrieval scores.

The dedup wrapper adapts Sarah's rubric into `dedup-judge-output-v0`, stores no NDD reasoning, retries only missing or invalid
rows inside the same server lifetime, and writes an explicit terminal error after the third failed attempt. Valid rows are
fsynced to the existing Judge cache. The standalone generic runner still writes NDD's native nested score objects; these
dedup-specific adaptation, retry, and accounting guarantees apply only when `judge.backend = "local_ndd"` is invoked through
`python -m eval.dedup`.

See [the dedup evaluation README](../dedup/README.md) for default Sarah commands and the separately named legacy NVIDIA/formal
V0 configs.

## Quick start

Start by copying and editing the files in `cc_extract_example/`. The YAML refers to adjacent Jinja files by relative path, so keep them together.

This is a minimal integration example, not a calibrated production evaluation. Its prompts, rubrics, model settings, thresholds, and concurrency values are illustrative and have not been optimized. Validate and adapt them on a manually reviewed sample before relying on results.

1. Set `models[0].model` in [text_extraction_qwen_judge.yaml](cc_extract_example/text_extraction_qwen_judge.yaml) to a model identifier or local model path.
2. Update [text_extraction_prompt.jinja](cc_extract_example/text_extraction_prompt.jinja) with the field names from your input rows.
3. Define the rubric outputs under each judge's `scores:` list.
4. Run a small input first.

```bash
python eval/llm_judge/run_llm_judge.py \
  --judge-config eval/llm_judge/cc_extract_example/text_extraction_qwen_judge.yaml \
  --input-path data/extracted.jsonl \
  --input-format jsonl \
  --output-path output/judged \
  --output-format jsonl
```

The bundled [text_extraction_qwen_gemma_judges.yaml](cc_extract_example/text_extraction_qwen_gemma_judges.yaml) runs the same extraction rubrics with both Qwen and Gemma. Use it when you want to compare model agreement; update the model paths and serving settings for your hardware before running it.

Use `--checkpoint-path output/judge_checkpoint` to write Curator checkpoint metadata to a durable location. It is useful for normal pipeline recovery, but you should still inspect input and output counts after a run.

## Input and output

The runner does not require a fixed text schema. A prompt can reference any fields present in an input JSONL or Parquet row. Keep a stable identifier such as `document_id` or `track_id` when you need to join results to another dataset.

```json
{
  "document_id": "article-42",
  "raw_text": "Example site | Subscribe | The article begins here ...",
  "justext_text": "The article begins here ...",
  "trafilatura_text": "The article begins here, with an extra footer ..."
}
```

NDD adds one top-level column for each judge. A judge named `extraction_quality` with a `quality` score produces a result shaped like this:

```json
{
  "extraction_quality": {
    "quality": {
      "reasoning": "The candidate retains the article body and drops the navigation.",
      "score": 4
    }
  }
}
```

An input field can be `null`. Make optional Jinja fields null-safe, for example `{{ (trafilatura_text or "")[:8000] }}` rather than `{{ trafilatura_text[:8000] }}`.

## Scaling with Slurm job arrays

For a large evaluation, split the input into many JSONL or Parquet files and submit one single-node job per Slurm array element. Curator automatically detects the Slurm array environment and deterministically assigns source-file tasks to array elements, so each job reads and judges only its assigned files. Each job starts its own local judge server on the GPUs allocated to that job.

A single input file is one source task and cannot be divided across array elements. Use multiple input files (typically with `--files-per-partition 1`) to create enough work to distribute. Array elements can write part files to a shared `--output-path`; use one shared, durable `--checkpoint-path` for the logical run and reuse it only when retrying that same run.

See the [Slurm tutorial](../../tutorials/slurm/README.md) for submission, runtime configuration, and retry patterns.

## Prompts

Jinja inserts values from the current row: `{{ field_name }}` becomes the value of `field_name` for that record. Use clear delimiters around untrusted source content and tell the model to treat it as evidence rather than instructions.

```jinja
<candidate_a>
{{ justext_text }}
</candidate_a>

<candidate_b>
{{ trafilatura_text }}
</candidate_b>
```

The bundled extraction prompts use character caps as conservative protection against unusually large Common Crawl pages. Those caps are task-specific starting points, not a general truncation policy. Choose limits from representative input lengths and the context window of the judge model. Reserve enough context for the system prompt, rendered prompt, NDD's structured-output instructions, and the requested completion.

If one judge needs an earlier judge's result, reference the nested score in a later prompt:

```jinja
The first judge gave content fidelity: {{ extraction_quality.content_fidelity.score }}
```

NDD detects that dependency and runs the first judge before the dependent one. Omitting `.score` inserts the complete structured result, including its reasoning.

## YAML configuration

The YAML has two main sections: `models` describes what Dynamo/vLLM serves, and `execution.stages` describes the judge columns to run.

```yaml
models:
  - alias: judge
    model: YOUR_JUDGE_MODEL
    served_model_name: YOUR_JUDGE_MODEL
    dynamo_model:
      num_replicas: 1
      mode: aggregated
      engine_kwargs:
        tensor_parallel_size: 1
        max_model_len: 32768
        max_num_seqs: 32
        gpu_memory_utilization: 0.8
    inference_parameters:
      temperature: 0.0
      max_tokens: 512
      max_parallel_requests: 8

execution:
  stages:
    - name: extraction_quality
      judges:
        - name: extraction_quality
          model_alias: judge
          system_prompt_path: text_extraction_system.jinja
          prompt_path: text_extraction_prompt.jinja
          scores:
            - name: quality
              description: Rate the candidate's usefulness as clean document text.
              options:
                1: Unusable.
                2: Major problems.
                3: Usable with noticeable problems.
                4: Good, with minor problems.
                5: Excellent.
```

`alias` is the name judges use to select a served model. `model` is the model identifier or local weights path. `served_model_name` is the API name exposed by Dynamo/vLLM and is useful when it differs from the local path.

Each judge needs a unique `name`, a `prompt_path`, and one or more rubric scores. Score option keys may be numeric or string labels, such as `unclear`. Use bare keys for intentional numeric outputs. Quote string labels that YAML would otherwise coerce to another type, such as `"yes"`, `"no"`, `"true"`, `"false"`, `"on"`, `"off"`, and `"null"`. A judge may omit `model_alias` to use the first configured model.

The bundled Qwen example disables thinking through `inference_parameters.extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`. Keep that setting for Qwen structured judging; remove it for providers that do not support it.

## Model support

Use a HuggingFace-format model vLLM can load, either local weights or a repo id. Some architectures require `trust_remote_code: true` in `engine_kwargs`, and architecture support varies by the installed Dynamo/vLLM version, so a serving failure can mean the version needs updating rather than that the model is unusable. The model has to fit the GPUs it's given (`tensor_parallel_size` per replica × `num_replicas`), and `max_model_len` has to cover the full rendered prompt plus `max_tokens`.

To download the Qwen judge model to a local path referenced by `models[].model`, for example:

```bash
hf download Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B \
  --local-dir /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B
```

A model that serves fine can still be a bad judge, and the only way to know is to run it. The prompt asks the model in plain language to answer with one of a fixed set of values, like "answer with exactly one of: yes, no, unclear." The pipeline checks that answer against the schema afterward. It doesn't stop the model from answering wrong in the first place — it just drops any row where the answer doesn't match. So a model that doesn't follow instructions well shows up as missing rows, not wrong scores.

Two common causes of dropped rows: `max_tokens` set too small for the rubric (more judges, more scores, and longer reasoning all need more room, and a cut-off answer fails the check), and a reasoning model whose thinking is eating the completion budget before it reaches the answer. If that's what's happening, disabling thinking (as in the Qwen example above) is one fix, though it trades away whatever the reasoning might otherwise have added to the judgment.

Smoke-test any new model against your rubric on a small sample before a full run.

## Execution mode and multiple models

By default, `--execution-mode single_stage` puts every configured judge into one NDD stage. Use it when NDD should schedule the whole dependency graph, including prompt dependencies between judges.

```text
reader, optional language filter, one NDD stage, filters, writer
```

Use `--execution-mode multi_stage` when configured judge groups need explicit Curator boundaries, separate stage runtime environments, or filters between groups.

```text
reader, optional language filter, NDD stage, filters, NDD stage, filters, writer
```

In `multi_stage` mode, set `num_workers` on an execution stage to pass a fixed worker count directly to that `DataDesignerStage` through `.with_(num_workers=...)`. This can stop the first NDD stage from taking every available Ray worker before downstream stages can run against their own served models.

```yaml
execution:
  stages:
    - name: qwen_judges
      num_workers: 1
      judges: [ ... ]
    - name: gemma_judges
      num_workers: 2
      judges: [ ... ]
```

In `single_stage`, use `execution.num_workers` to set the worker count for the one combined NDD stage:

```yaml
execution:
  num_workers: 2
  stages:
    - name: qwen_judges
      judges: [ ... ]
```

In `multi_stage`, `num_workers` remains a stage-level setting because one `DataDesignerStage` owns all judge columns in that group. For individual judge limits, put each judge in a separate execution stage and set `execution.stages[].num_workers`. Stage-level values are not applied in `single_stage`; `execution.num_workers` is not applied in `multi_stage`.

Neither setting limits requests by itself; each worker can still submit up to its model's `max_parallel_requests`.

This creates useful multi-stage overlap only when the reader produces multiple Curator tasks. Shard a large input into multiple files; a single JSONL file is one input task and cannot flow into the next NDD stage until its first stage finishes.

Multiple models are supported by adding entries with distinct aliases under `models` and selecting `model_alias` per judge. Start every model through the same Dynamo server only when their worker environment requirements are compatible.

## Traces and filters

Every rubric result already includes a short `reasoning` field. Use `with_trace: last_message` for occasional structured-output debugging, or `with_trace: all_messages` while developing prompts and inspecting rendered input. Full traces duplicate prompt content in the output, so turn them off for large production runs unless they are needed. Set `extract_reasoning_content: true` only when you specifically need a provider's separate reasoning-content field.

Add `filters:` at the top level to retain only records that satisfy judge scores. The filter's `judge` is the top-level output column, and `score` is the nested rubric name.

```yaml
filters:
  - judge: extraction_quality
    score: quality
    operator: gte
    value: 4
```

The example supports `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, and `not_in`. Multiple filters use AND semantics. Top-level filters are placed immediately after the stage that produces their judge column; a filter can also be placed under a specific execution stage when you deliberately need it later. Before Ray or the model server starts, the runner checks that every filter refers to a configured judge column and score.

## Analyzing results

Running the same rubric through multiple LLMs turns judge agreement into a signal, not just a sanity check: where the models agree, the record is likely easy and the score can be trusted with less scrutiny; where they disagree, look into why before trusting the rubric or filter at scale. A disagreement can mean the record is genuinely ambiguous or hard to score — evidence for a human-in-the-loop or an `unresolved`-style rubric option — or it can mean the prompt or rubric wording is too vague or underspecified for a model to apply consistently, which calls for tightening the prompt rather than trusting either score.

The writer emits one or more JSONL/Parquet part files under `--output-path`; load the whole directory, then pull each judge's nested score into its own column.

```python
import glob
import pandas as pd

df = pd.concat(pd.read_json(path, lines=True) for path in glob.glob("output/judged/*.jsonl"))

# Two judges applying the same rubric to different models.
df["qwen_quality"] = df["extraction_quality_qwen"].apply(lambda r: r["quality"]["score"])
df["gemma_quality"] = df["extraction_quality_gemma"].apply(lambda r: r["quality"]["score"])

df["quality_diff"] = df["qwen_quality"] - df["gemma_quality"]
print(df["quality_diff"].value_counts().sort_index())  # agreement distribution

disagreements = df[df["quality_diff"].abs() >= 2].sort_values("quality_diff", key=abs, ascending=False)
disagreements[["document_id", "qwen_quality", "gemma_quality"]].head(20)
```

Read both `reasoning` fields on a disagreement (`df.loc[idx, "extraction_quality_qwen"]["quality"]["reasoning"]`) to tell the two causes apart: differing-but-reasonable justifications point to a genuinely hard record, while justifications that latch onto different aspects of the same instructions point to a vague prompt. The same pattern extends to comparing two rubrics on one model, or checking a filter threshold before committing to it.

## Operating guidance

Start with a manually reviewed calibration sample. Confirm rendered prompts, structured results, and context lengths before increasing concurrency. For a model that fits on one GPU, begin with one replica and modest `max_parallel_requests`; increase requests gradually only after checking for context-length errors, malformed outputs, and GPU memory pressure. Add replicas when additional GPUs are available and the workload is large enough to use them.

`max_model_len` limits total request context, while `max_tokens` limits only the completion. Increasing `max_model_len` consumes KV-cache capacity; it does not make oversized raw documents safe. `max_num_seqs` should be at least the intended in-flight load, but increasing it by itself does not improve throughput.

For the optional FastText language gate, provide `--language`, `--fasttext-langid-model-path`, and optionally `--min-langid-score` and `--language-text-field`. Omitting `--language` skips the stage and does not require FastText.

Press `Ctrl-C` once to cancel a local Dynamo run and allow normal Ray and inference-server cleanup to finish. If cancellation interrupts cleanup, inspect remaining model-server subprocesses before starting another run.

## Common adaptations

| Goal | Prompt fields | Useful scores |
|---|---|---|
| Compare extracted text to raw HTML or text | source plus `{{ candidate_text }}` | fidelity, boilerplate removal, usability |
| Judge PDF parser output | OCR or rendered-page text plus `{{ parsed_text }}` | coverage, reading order, hallucination |
| Route screening to adjudication | an earlier score plus source fields | pass/fail, final decision |

For every adaptation, begin with a small manually reviewed sample and tune the prompt and rubric before processing a large corpus.
